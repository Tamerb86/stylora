## Security Best Practices

Protecting your Vipps credentials and customer payment data is critical. Follow these security guidelines:

### Credential Management

| Best Practice | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Never Share Credentials** | Do not share API keys via email, chat, or public channels |
| **Use Environment Variables** | Store credentials in secure environment variables, not in code |
| **Rotate Keys Regularly** | Change API keys every 6-12 months |
| **Limit Access** | Only grant Vipps Portal access to trusted team members |
| **Monitor Activity** | Regularly review transaction logs for suspicious activity |

### Compliance

Ensure your Vipps integration complies with:

- **PCI DSS** (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **Norwegian Privacy Laws** (Personopplysningsloven)

> **Note:** BarberTime handles all payment processing securely. You never store or process raw payment card data, reducing your PCI compliance burden.
